//Q. Peter asked his friend Max to implement a java program in which 3 integers X, Y and N are given as a runtime input and all the numbers between X and Y which are divisible by N must be displayed on console. If no such number is possible for the given input then, print NO OUTPUT.
Input format: 3 space separated integers X, Y and N
Constraint: X, Y and N are less than 1000
X and Y are positive integers and X < Y
Output format: All the integers between X and Y separated by space which are divisible by N

Solution-
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int x=sc.nextInt();
        int y=sc.nextInt();
        int z=sc.nextInt();
        int count=0;

        for(int i=x; i<=y; i++)
        {
            if(i%z==0)
            {
                System.out.print(i);
                System.out.print(" ");
                count=1;
            }
        }
        if(count==0)
            System.out.println("NO OUTPUT");
    }
}
